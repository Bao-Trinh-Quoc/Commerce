we back, bACK. 
hmm pretty confusing here but I think we will use listing.current_price

small project: LISTING PAGE
* implement click on listing
 * If the user is signed in, the user should be able to add the item to their “Watchlist.” \
 If the item is already on the watchlist, the user should be able to remove it.

ehh tmrr I think when we implement view watchlist need to check the database again
stop at add item to watchlist

18/5
* bid on the item -- done
* close the auction -- done
stop at add comments to the listing page

02/06
